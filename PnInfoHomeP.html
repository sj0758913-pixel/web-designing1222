        <h1>Web Designing</h1>
        <div class="d">
            <p>Something which makes PN INFOSYS different from other IT companies is that we train novice students and
                also make them work on Live projects. Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on
                the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than
                software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however,
                since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important. At PN
                INFOSYS, we pride ourselves on being more than just another IT company. One of the key aspects that
                makes us stand out is our commitment to nurturing the next generation of IT professionals. We don't just
                provide theoretical training to novice students—we actively involve them in hands-on learning through
                live projects. By doing this, we ensure that our trainees gain practical experience, develop critical
                problem-solving skills, and are better prepared to tackle real-world challenges. This unique approach
                gives our students a competitive edge, allowing them to transition smoothly from learners to
                professionals.</p>

            <p>Something which makes PN INFOSYS different from other IT companies is that we train novice students and
                also make them work on Live projects. Web development is the work involved in developing a website for
                the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from
                developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses,
                and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly
                refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
                client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
                development.Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
                building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS)
                to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>

        <h1 class="panel3">App Development</h1>

            <p>Something which makes PN INFOSYS different from other IT companies is that we train novice students and
                also make them work on Live projects. Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app
                is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or
                mobile phones. These software applications are designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone
                or tablet computer. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or
                delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide
                an "application-like" experience within a web browser. Application software developers also must
                consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense
                competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been
                steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct
                app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members (including the UK), 60 percent of which are mobile app
                developers.</p>
